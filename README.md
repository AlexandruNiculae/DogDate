# DogDate
DogDate is a mobile app that will allow dog owners and cat owners to have play-meetings in which pets can spend time in the presence of other animals. It offers dog owners that fear to go on a longer walk at night alone company, so they will safe. It offers cat owners to leave their cats with somebody that can be trusted and to somebody that the pet likes.

##While browsing  
While browsing you can choose between walks or play-meetings depending on your pet. A list of all users that will take out their dog in 2 or less hours will appear for the 'Walks' option or a list of cat owners that want to play with their cats.

Once you have found the 'one' that you would like to meet you just press on him/her and you will be able to message him/her. This person will receive the message in his or hers inbox
